The Stable Diffusion API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.
The Stable Diffusion API uses keys to authenticate the requests. Pass the key you've obtained from the API Settings page to the request body and follow all the endpoint processes accordingly.

Send JSON POST requests with data and links.
